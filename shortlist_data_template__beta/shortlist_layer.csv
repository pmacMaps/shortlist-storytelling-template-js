Horton Plaza,Design,This brightly decorated open-air shopping mall sparked off the redevelopment of downtown San Diego.,"Horton Plaza was one of the first successful downtown shopping malls in the US. In 1985 when it was built, Horton Plaza was a groundbreaking and risky development because downtown San Diego was rather tawdry and avoided by many.","But with its playful architectural details and zany layout, designed by Jon Jerde, Horton Plaza was an instant success and quickly became the catalyst for the redevelopment of downtown and the Gaslamp as a popular destination for locals and visitors.","Inside you'll find all the usual stores, cinemas, and a food court. Two theaters and a hotel are integrated into the design, with an open-air, multi-level 'street' running through the middle.","This type of mall is rather routine nowadays however, and to contemporary planners Horton Plaza may perhaps seem a little disengaged from the surrounding streets. But that likely reflects the state of the downtown area when Horton Plaza was conceived.","Unusually, a vacant building in the complex facing a historic park on Broadway, is slated to be demolished to enlarge the park and create a grand urban open space.",http://links.esri.com/sandiego/places/horton_plaza,http://downloads.esri.com/blogs/places/sandiego/horton_plaza_large.jpg,http://downloads.esri.com/blogs/places/sandiego/horton_plaza_thumb.jpg,32.71386602,-117.1625683
