# Esri Shortlist Story Map Customizations

This fork of the [Esri Shortlist Story Map](https://github.com/Esri/shortlist-storytelling-template-js) provides the code to various customizations I have made in live deployments of the application.  

The **Master Branch** contains the customizations for version **_2.7.0_**, while the [**ver-1.4.9 Branch**](https://github.com/pmacMaps/shortlist-storytelling-template-js/tree/ver-1.4.9) contains the customizations for version **_1.4.9_** of the Shortlist StoryMap.  The application underwent a major re-write at Version _2.x_.

Below is a listing of the customizations I have made:

- A toggable legend located on the map.  This uses the **esri request** module from the JS API.  It currently assumes map services as the source for legend elements.  
- Text placeholder in the header area of the app for the date the data was last updated.
- A map/app loading message for desktop and mobile versions of the app (v 1.4.9).

Detailed descriptions of the customizations will be added to the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/pmacMaps/shortlist-storytelling-template-js/wiki) page in the near future.
