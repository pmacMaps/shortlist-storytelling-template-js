# shortlist-storytelling-template-js - Static Legend Plugin

This fork of the Shortlist" story map provides a method to add a static, toggable legend to the application.  The legend is considered static because the legend is created using a HTML unordered list, as opposed to creating the legend from the map/feature service.  jQuery is utilized to add the toggable functionality to the legend, as well as control when the legend displays below the mobile breakpoint.

The static legend involves the following changes to the application:

1.	Adding the <strong>jquery.shortlist-legend.css</strong> stylesheet, which controls the layout of the legend and legend button
   
      a.	Add this file to the <strong>"app/css/"</strong> directory
   
      b.	Add the stylesheet within the `<head>` element around <em>line 91</em> on the <strong>index.html</strong> file.
   
      c.	Adjust the stylesheet to suit the needs of your application


2.	Adding the `<div id="customLegendBtn">` element at the top of the `<div id="map">` around <em>line 156</em> of the <strong>index.html</strong> file.
   
      a.	 This is the legend button that users will click/press to toggle the legend on/off.


3.	Add `<h3>Legend</h3>` within the `<div id="customLegendBtn">` element


4.	Immediately below the `<div id="customLegendBtn">` element, add the `<div id="customLegend">` element around <em>line 159</em> of the <strong>index.html</strong> file.
   
      a. This element will contain the legend contents


5.	Add legend elements within the `<div id="customLegend">` using `<ul><li>[Name of Layer]</li><li>[image representing layer]<img alt="" src="resources/images/legend/[name of image]"</li></ul>` structure.


6.	Created a folder named <strong>"images"</strong> within the <strong>"resources/images/"</strong> directory.
   
      a.	The images for the legend should be stored here.


7.	Make the following changes within the <strong>main.js</strong> file within the <strong>"app/js/"</strong> directory:
   
      a.	Around <em>line 86</em>, create a variable to hold the viewport width
   
         var viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;

      b.	Around <em>line 528</em>, within the <strong>if(_map.loaded)</strong> conditional statement, add the following code:

         
         if (viewportWidth > 767) {
   	      $('#customLegendBtn').show();
   		}
   		
						
         note: This will show the legend button on devices above the mobile breakpoint.
         This elementâ€™s diplay is set to none by default.

   c. Around <em>line 2275</em>, within the <strong>function selectMobileTheme(index)</strong>, add the following code:

         $('#customLegendBtn').show()
   
      note: This will show the legend button below the mobile breakpoint once the map becomes visiable.  This occurs after the user selects a button for one of the tab layers

   d.	At the end of the file, around <em>line 2398</em>, add the following code to add the toggable function to the legend button.  This will allow the legend to be turned on and off

         $('#customLegendBtn').click(function () {
	         $('#customLegend').toggle();
         });
